A custom WordPress plugin named **Post Statistics**, developed as part of a Udemy course on WordPress development. This plugin enhances single post pages by displaying key statistics such as word count, character count, and estimated reading time.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This plugin is designed to demonstrate how to build a functional WordPress plugin from scratch. It adds a settings page in the WordPress admin panel, allowing users to customize the display of post statistics. Key concepts covered in its development include:

- Hooking into WordPress actions and filters.
- Adding custom admin settings pages.
- Using PHP to manipulate and display post data dynamically.
- Registering and sanitizing plugin options.

## 📚 What I Learned
